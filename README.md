[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/adventuresinodyssey?label=PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/adventuresinodyssey/)  
# adventuresinodyssey
Unofficial python API clients for the Adventures in Odyssey Club and website.

```bash
pip install adventuresinodyssey
```

I recomend using [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) for streaming episodes.
```bash
pip install mpv
```

This is currently in very early development, some stuff might not work or break.
